# ArchiLudo Architecture

## Layering

ArchiLudo is deliberately split into two layers that never mix:

```
src/game_logic.c   <-- pure C rules engine, zero OSLib/WIMP dependency
src/main.c         <-- RISC OS WIMP shell (iconbar icon, Wimp_Poll loop)
```

`game_logic.c`/`include/game_logic.h` know nothing about RISC OS, sprites,
windows, or SWIs -- they only know about pawns, dice, and turns. This is
what lets the exact same source file be:

- cross-compiled with ArchieSDK's `arm-archie-gcc` into the real game
  (linked into `src/main.c` in the normal `all`/`ArchiLudo,ff8` build), and
- compiled with the **host's own `cc`** and exercised by
  `tests/test_game_logic.c` for automated testing (`make test`), with no
  ArchieSDK, no Arculator, and no RISC OS ROM involved at all.

See [BUILDCHAIN.md](BUILDCHAIN.md) for how the two separate compilation
paths are wired up in the Makefile, and [GAME_LOGIC.md](GAME_LOGIC.md) for
the rules engine's data model and API in detail.

Why this split matters here specifically: the WIMP shell can only be
verified visually, by hand, inside Arculator (see the "Testing" section of
the top-level `CLAUDE.md` for why -- Arculator has no headless/scriptable
mode). Automating *that* isn't possible. Automating the actual game rules
is, and that's where bugs are cheapest to catch, so the rules engine is
kept 100% independent of the shell precisely so it doesn't have to share
that limitation.

## Current state

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| `game_logic.c` | Complete rules engine (see [GAME_LOGIC.md](GAME_LOGIC.md)), fully unit tested |
| `main.c` | Smoke-test WIMP shell only: iconbar icon, quits on click/`Message_Quit`. Not yet wired to `game_logic.c` |
| Board/dice/pawn rendering | Not started -- will use RISC OS Sprites plotted in a window redraw handler, per the GeoLudo->Wimp mapping below |
| Dialogue boxes, menus | Not started |

The next real implementation step is wiring `game_logic.c` into an actual
game window: a `wimp_window` with a redraw handler that plots the board
and pawns as sprites, an icon-bar/window menu (Game/File/Info), and a
handful of small dialogue windows for player setup and save/load -- see
the porting table below for what that reuses from GeoLudo and what's new.

## Directory layout

```

    game_logic.h      -- rules engine API + full rules writeup
    archiludo.h        -- WIMP shell shared declarations

## Porting source: GeoLudo -> ArchiLudo

`/home/xahmol/git/ludo` holds this game's prior ports across 8-bit
platforms and is the source of truth for the rules and prior art.
`GEOS/` (2023 GEOS edition) is the closest existing analogue to
ArchiLudo's architecture, since GEOS is itself a real WIMP environment:
real menu trees, real dialogue boxes, icon-driven actions. The mapping
below (also recorded in the approved scaffolding plan,
`~/.claude/plans/i-want-to-scaffolf-dreamy-lantern.md`) is the porting
strategy for the UI layer once it's built:

| GEOS (source) | ArchiLudo (RISC OS Wimp) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `struct menu` tree (`menuGEOS`/`menuGame`/`menuFile`) | `wimp_menu` tree via `Wimp_CreateMenu` | Direct structural match |
| `DlgBoxGetString`/`DlgBoxYesNo`/`DlgBoxOk`/`DlgBoxOkCancel` | A small reusable dialogue-window helper built on plain Wimp windows | Wimp has no built-in dialogue-box kernel call like GEOS does |
| `SaveFile`/`GetFile` (GEOS's directory-listing file picker) | RISC OS-native Save box + drag-and-drop (`Message_DataSave`/`DataSaveAck`, `Message_DataOpen`) | Idiomatic RISC OS UX, not a literal port |
| `throwicon`/`nexticon` (`struct icontab`) | Ordinary `wimp_icon`s inside the game window | Direct conceptual match |
| Custom per-platform bitmap/colour-card plotting (`interface.c`, `geoscore.s`) | RISC OS Sprites (`OS_SpriteOp`) in a window redraw handler | GEOS needed hand-written pixel code per 8-bit machine; RISC OS's sprite plotter is uniform |
| `monochromeflag`, `VDC_CLR0..4`, `Switch4080` | One fixed screen mode | VIDC gives every Archimedes the same colour capability under RISC OS 3.10 |
| Overlay/VLIR loading (`loadoverlay`/`openVLIR`/`closeVLIR`) | None -- program stays resident | 1MB+ RAM makes this unnecessary |
| `gamelogic.c` (`turngeneric`, `pawnselect`, dice/AI) | Reimplemented cleanly as `game_logic.c` (see below) | See [GAME_LOGIC.md](GAME_LOGIC.md) for why this isn't a literal port |

## Why `game_logic.c` is a clean reimplementation, not a literal port

The original 1992 Commodore 128 BASIC program (and its 2023 GEOS C port)
use single/double-letter variable names (`ap`, `as`, `vr`, `vl`, `vn`,
`nr`, `gv`, `ov`, `ro`, `np`, `dp`, `zv`) with no surviving documentation
of what most of them represent -- the author's own words: "sparsely
documented... sometimes have no clue anymore what variables do." Copying
that exact numeric encoding byte-for-byte would mean reproducing bugs and
ambiguities nobody can currently verify, and would produce a module nobody
could safely modify or test with confidence.

Instead, `game_logic.c` is implemented directly from the plain-English
rules text the author has maintained consistently across every other port
(the "Game rules" sections of `/home/xahmol/git/ludo/README.md` and
`.../GEOS/README.md`), using clearly-named variables, a simple single
integer "steps travelled" position model (see
[GAME_LOGIC.md](GAME_LOGIC.md)), and a full docstring-style comment above
every function (summary/syntax/input/output) rather than sparse or absent
documentation. This also gave an opportunity to verify the rules make
internal sense as a state machine (they do) and simplify where the more
powerful Archimedes removes a constraint the 8-bit versions had to design
around (see the table above).
